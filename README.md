This program consists of three main functions: add, print, delete. The add function prompts the user to input information about a new student, which is then stored in a vector of Student struct ptrs. The print function outputs the information for all current students. The delete function asks the user for a student ID before removing that struct from the vector. Lastly, the program ends with a "QUIT" command.
